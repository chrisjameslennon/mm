###### How does contact sharing work in Voyzu?6
Voyzu contacts are automatically downloaded into a special #voyzu shared folder within Google contacts. Synchronization is one way - changes you make within Voyzu are automatically applied to users' Google contacts. Changes users make in within Google contacts are not synchronized.

###### Are contacts that don't have #voyzu shared label ever shared with other users?
No. Your private contacts remain private and are never shared with other users. Only contacts you choose to share (i.e. those with the #voyzu shared label) are shared

###### What is the cost of the Voyzu shared user feature?
A free version and subscription based plans are available, see our pricing page

###### Can I share contacts with users outside my G Suite domain?
No. Voyzu Shared Contacts for G Suite has been purpose designed to allow companies and organizations to maintain a global list of organization-wide contacts.

###### Can I control which users have access to the #voyzu shared label?
You can, as a domain administrator. Log in to Voyzu and navigate to the 'Users' menu. From there you can search for users and select which users you want to give access to company shared contacts

###### How do I import contacts into my Voyzu Shared Contacts?
There is currently no bulk import feature, this feature will be released in the next few weeks.

###### When I add a new user to my G Suite domain, will they automatically get access to the #voyzu shared label?
Yes - this is the default. You can change this setting by logging into Voyzu and clicking the 'Settings' cog.

###### Can I apply other labels to contacts having the #voyzu shared label?
No, as if the shared contact is later edited, any labels applied (other than the # voyzu shared label) will be deleted. A label syncronization feature is under development.

###### Is there a limit to the number of users I can share contacts with across my G Suite domain?
Yes there is a limit of 50 users participating in contacts sharing. If you want to share across more than 50 users then contact us to learn more about our higher volume plans

###### Is there a limit to the number of shared contacts I can have?
For free edition customers the limit is 30 contacts. For customers with a subscription there is a limit of 10,000 shared contacts. If you want to share over 10,000 contacts then contact us to learn more about our higher volume plans

###### Are changes I make to my shared contacts in Google contacts automatically synchronized?
No, syncronization is one way. The change you make in Google contacts will be discarded the next time this contact is changed in Voyzu.
