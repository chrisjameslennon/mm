Here you can manage contacts in the Voyzu shared contacts master list for your
Domain. All contacts in this list are downloaded to the
<code>#voyzu shared</code> Google contacts label for users who participate in contacts sharing.

You can manage which of your Domain users participate in contacts sharing in the 'Users' screen.
