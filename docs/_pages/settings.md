###### Default sharing mode
Voyzu supports two modes for new domain users:
**Share by default**
In this mode new domain users will automatically have the
<code>#voyzu shared</code> contacts label
 created for them. You can later remove a user's access to this folder in the 'users' screen.

**Don't share by default**
In this mode new domain users will not have access to the
<code>#voyzu shared</code> contacts label
unless you specifically allow them access (which can be done in the 'users' screen)

Viewing and managing settings is an admin only function, only domain admins
or delegated admins can see this page
