<p class="lead color-2 italic mb-1">An overview of the differences between G Suite Directory
contacts and Voyzu shared contacts</p>

<h4 class="bold">Voyzu Shared contacts</h4>
<p>Voyzu Shared contacts are regular Google Contacts that have been added to a special
contacts label #voyzu shared

</figure>
<p>
These are regular Google contacts, and can be added,
edited, merged, printed, emailed or imported or exported. If you have <a
href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/voyzu_contacts_directory/337624936001?pann=gam"
target="_blank">installed Voyzu from the G Suite marketplace</a> you will notice
that you and your users have the #voyzu shared
contacts label automatically added.
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The free version of Voyzu Shared Contacts allows you to share up to 30
contacts with up to 3 users. Subscribe
to Voyzu Shared Contacts Full Edition to manage up to 10,000
contacts, accross 300 domain users.
See the <a href="pricing.html">pricing page</a> for more information.
</p>



<h4 class="bold">G Suite Directory contacts</h4>
<p>G Suite Directory contacts live in the G Suite Directory. The G Suite directory is a
read
only list containing your domain users and any external contacts you have added. The
list can be viewed
in Google contacts by clicking on the 'Directory' label.

</figure>

This list of external contacts and domain users is sometimes also
known as the 'Global Directory', 'External Contact List' or 'Global Address List
(GAL)'.
</p>
<p>
This list is read only for all users, including administrators. If you are logged in
to Google using your G Suite account email and visit your <a target="_blank"
href="https://contacts.google.com">google contacts</a> and click on 'Directory'
you will notice there is no option to add a new contact. Also contacts cannot be
edited, merged, printed, emailed or imported or exported. Contacts
can only be managed using the G Suite Contacts API (requires software development
expertise) or using a third party application such as <a
href="/contacts-directory/index.html">Voyzu Contacts Directory</a>
</p>


<h4 class="bold">Can I use both Directory contacts and Voyzu shared contacts?</h4>
<p>You can. Shared contacts and Directory contacts are two separate and independent
lists.
</p>


<h4 class="bold">Which method of sharing contacts should I use?</h4>
<p>The G Suite Directory is a read only list of contacts - users can see Directory
contacts but cannot add or edit contacts. Domain admins manage this global, read-only list in Voyzu.
This works for organizations that want to
maintain a central read-only list of contacts and
want to control access to who can modify data in this list. Modifying Directory
contacts is done in Voyzu,
so you need to log into Voyzu to manage contacts. Directory contacts do not appear
on your users mobile devices.
</p>
<p> Voyzu shared contacts on the other hand can be edited by all users who have access
to the #voyzu shared label. Users can manage this list
themselves, with changes being shared across all participating domain users. Users
do not need to leave their familiar Google
environment and can make changes within <a target="_blank"
href="https://contacts.googlecom">Google contacts</a>. Voyzu Shared
contacts are fully accessible on mobile devices</p>
<p>If you can't decide between the two methods, our recommendation is to go with Voyzu
shared contacts</p>
