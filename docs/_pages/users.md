<!--voyzu help content-->
This page shows a list (updated every hour) of all your G Suite domain users.
On this screen you can choose which users you want to replicate the master voyzu contacts list
to.
Users you are replicating contacts to
will have a <code>#voyzu shared</code> label created in their Google contacts
automatically and that label will contain all contacts in your Voyzu contacts master list.

###### Access to voyzu
- Any user participating in contact replication can log in to Voyzu
- Domain administrators (super admins) can always log into Voyzu
- Only Domain administrators can manage users (i.e. see the Users screen)

###### Default settings
When you first install Voyzu only the Voyzu Google Workspace administrator will have
replication turned on.
By default any new domain users created since install will have replication enabled.
You can change replication defaults in 'Settings' which can be accessed via the cog
icon on the top right of the screen.
