### Welcome

to the Voyzu Shared Contacts documentation site.  If you have not yet installed Voyzu Shared Contacts Manager you can [install it](market) - also see [getting started](getting-started)

If you find a mistake or something that is missing from this documentation, please head on over to the [github repository](https://github.com/chrisjameslennon/mm/) that contains the source code for this site, and raise an issue (or a pull request if you are technically inclined)
